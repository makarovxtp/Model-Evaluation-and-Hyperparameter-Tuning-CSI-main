# Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to train, evaluate, and optimize multiple machine learning models using classical model evaluation techniques and hyperparameter tuning methods. The work is done using the **Digits dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

- ✅ **Train multiple machine learning models** and evaluate their performance using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

- ✅ **Optimize model parameters** using:
  - `GridSearchCV`
  - `RandomizedSearchCV`

- ✅ **Compare and analyze results** across models and tuning methods to:
  - Identify the best-performing model
  - Justify model selection using both visual and metric-based analysis

## 🧠 What the Project Does

This project follows a complete machine learning pipeline:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
   - Loads the Digits dataset (8x8 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits).
   - Adds random noise to simulate real-world imperfections.
   - Scales features using `StandardScaler`.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**  
   - Trains and evaluates three models:
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Random Forest Classifier  
     - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - Uses evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Applies both `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV` to improve model performance.
   - Compares tuned vs untuned models to measure improvement.

4. **Results Analysis**  
   - Uses confusion matrices, classification reports, and visualizations.
   - Selects the best-performing model based on comprehensive evaluation.

## 📊 Key Results

- Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved the performance of SVC and Random Forest.
- Visualizations helped compare models clearly on both precision and recall.
- Final selection was based on a balance of F1-score and model generalizability.
